my dotfiles for the perfect yellow submarine with a periscope to the real world.

## manager

Uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for creating symlinks to the home directory.

And a [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for simple setup tasks.

## principles

 1. `main` branch for shared configuration
 2. sub branches for OS or Package Manager configurations
 3. minimal as possible, kept in sync
 4. folders prefixed with `@` are ignored by stow
